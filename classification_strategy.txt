Insurance Claim Risk Classification Strategy

This document outlines the logic used to classify insurance claims into High, Medium, or Low Risk levels based on structured rules.

Risk Rules:

R1: High - prior_claims >= 5
R2: High - prior_claims >= 4 AND urgency == "Yes"
R3: High - amount > upper threshold for claim type
R4: High - urgency == "Yes" AND prior_claims >= 3 AND amount in upper third range
R5: Medium - prior_claims == 2 or 3
R6: Medium - urgency == "Yes" AND amount in mid-range for claim type
R7: Medium - amount near upper limit AND urgency == "No"
R8: Medium - prior_claims >= 4 AND urgency == "No"
R9: Low - prior_claims <= 1 AND amount in low-mid range

Claim Type Thresholds:

Health Insurance - Low Range: 50,000 | High Range: 250,000
Auto Insurance - Low Range: 35,000 | High Range: 75,000
Renters Insurance - Low Range: 10,000 | High Range: 25,000
Burglary & Theft - Low Range: 10,000 | High Range: 25,000
Property Damage - Low Range: 75,000 | High Range: 250,000

Evaluation Priority:
- Always evaluate in order: High -> Medium -> Low
- Assign the highest matching risk level
- Do not mix rules

Example Mapping:

- Claim ID: ggfv0975 
- Type: Health Insurance  
- Amount: 878262.73  
- Prior Claims: 3  
- Urgency: Yes  
- Risk Level: High (Amount exceeds High threshold)

Purpose:
This classification helps prioritize risk review workflows and flag high-risk claims early in the pipeline.
