INSURANCE CLAIM RISK TAGGING RULES
===================================

Each insurance claim will be tagged as HIGH RISK, MEDIUM RISK, or LOW RISK based on the following key factors:
- Type of Insurance
- Amount Claimed
- Urgency of Claim
- Prior Claims in the Last 12 Months

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. HIGH RISK
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A claim will be considered HIGH RISK if **any one** of the following conditions is met:

▶ GENERAL:
- prior_claims >= 5
- prior_claims >= 4 AND urgency == "Yes"
- amount > upper threshold for claim type (defined below)
- urgency == "Yes" AND prior_claims >= 3 AND amount in upper third of range

▶ BY TYPE:
- Health Insurance: amount > 250,000
- Auto Insurance: amount > 75,000
- Renters Insurance: amount > 25,000
- Burglary & Theft: amount > 25,000
- Property Damage: amount > 250,000

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. MEDIUM RISK
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A claim will be considered MEDIUM RISK if any of the following apply:

▶ GENERAL:
- prior_claims == 2 or 3
- urgency == "Yes" and amount in mid-range
- amount near upper limit but urgency == "No"
- urgency == "No" AND prior_claims >= 4

▶ BY TYPE (example mid-ranges):
- Health Insurance: 50,000 < amount <= 250,000
- Auto Insurance: 35,000 < amount <= 75,000
- Renters Insurance: 10,000 < amount <= 25,000
- Burglary & Theft: 10,000 < amount <= 25,000
- Property Damage: 75,000 < amount <= 250,000

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. LOW RISK
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A claim will be considered LOW RISK if all of the following are true:
- prior_claims <= 1
- amount in low-mid range (see below)

▶ BY TYPE (example low-ranges):
- Health Insurance: amount <= 50,000
- Auto Insurance: amount <= 35,000
- Renters Insurance: amount <= 10,000
- Burglary & Theft: amount <= 10,000
- Property Damage: amount <= 75,000

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
- These rules are meant to support automated triage and flagging.
- Human review may still be required for claims on the border between Medium and High Risk.
- Historical patterns and additional metadata may enhance this framework.
